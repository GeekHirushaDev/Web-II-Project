# Web-II-Project

## Project Overview
This project is an analysis and implementation of a web application. It consists of two main components:

1. **Backend**: Built using Java, it includes controllers, models, and database connectivity.
2. **Frontend**: Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.

## Folder Structure

### Backend
- `build.xml`: Build configuration file.
- `src/`: Contains Java source files.
  - `controller/`: Includes controllers like `CreateNewAccount.java`.
  - `model/`: Includes models like `User.java`.
- `web/`: Contains web-related files like `index.html` and configuration files.
- `lib/`: Includes external libraries like `gson` and `mysql-connector`.

### Frontend
- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for frontend logic.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling.

## Database
- `Database.sql`: SQL file for database schema and initialization.

## How to Run

### Backend
1. Ensure you have Java installed.
2. Use `build.xml` to compile and deploy the backend.
3. Place the required libraries (`gson` and `mysql-connector`) in the `lib/` folder.

### Frontend
1. Open `Frontend/index.html` in a browser.
